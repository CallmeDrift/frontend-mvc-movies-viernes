            lyrics: `
        Your blades are sharpened with precision
        Flashing your favorite point of view
        I know you're waiting in the distance
        Just like you always do, just like you always do
        Already pulling me in, already under my skin
        And I know exactly how this ends
        I let you cut me open, just to watch me bleed
        Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
        Don't know why I'm hoping for what I won't receive
        Falling for the promise of the emptiness machine
        The emptiness machine
        Going around like a revolver
        It's been decided how we lose
        'Cause there's a fire under the altar
        I keep on lying to, I keep on lying to
        Already pulling me in, already under my skin
        And I know exactly how this ends
        I let you cut me open just to watch me bleed
        Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
        Don't know why I'm hoping for what I won't receive
        Falling for the promise of the emptiness machine
        I only wanted to be part of something
        I only wanted to be part of, part of
        I only wanted to be part of something
        I only wanted to be part of, part of
        I only wanted to be part of something
        I only wanted to be part
        I let you cut me open, just to watch me bleed
        Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
        Don't know why I'm hoping, so fucking naive
        Falling for the promise of the emptiness machine
        The emptiness machine (I only wanted to be part of something)
        The emptiness machine (I only wanted to be part of)
        The emptiness machine

            title: 'Faint',
            lyrics: `
I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact that everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel
But it's like, no matter what I do, I can't convince you to just believe this is real
So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
I am a little bit insecure, a little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can, but sometimes I don't make sense
I am what you never want to say, but I've never had a doubt
It's like, no matter what I do, I can't convince you for once just to hear me out
So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
No, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now (I can't feel the way I did before)
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
